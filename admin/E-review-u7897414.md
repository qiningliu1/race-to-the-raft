Reviewing code written by: <Ishaan Kapoor> <u7598889>

Component: <the Decks class>

### Comments 

<The best feature of this code lies in its completeness and coherence, with a clear logical structure. 
Firstly, it is well-documented with clear explanations provided through Javadoc comments, enhancing readability and facilitating maintenance. 
The program decomposition is appropriate, with logical division into classes and methods, contributing to code organization and clarity. 
Additionally, the adherence to Java code conventions is evident, as methods and variables are properly named, and the coding style remains consistent throughout the class.

However, there are areas for improvement. The use of hardcoded data for representing decks may lead to redundancy and maintenance issues if deck contents require modification.
Employing data structures or external data sources could offer greater flexibility in managing deck data. 
Moreover, there is a potential error in the code related to input validation. 
If the input deckString in the constructor contains an invalid deck identifier, such as a character not corresponding to any deck, the program may encounter unexpected behavior or throw exceptions. 
Implementing input validation to handle such scenarios gracefully would enhance the robustness of the code.

In summary, while the code exhibits commendable features such as clear documentation, appropriate program decomposition, and adherence to coding conventions, addressing areas of improvement such as reducing reliance on hardcoded data and implementing input validation would enhance the overall quality and robustness of the codebase.

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to Ishaan. Despite being the youngest member in our group, he is the most dependable. He is quite intelligent and diligent, capable of completing the majority of the assignments even without our assistance. However, he consistently engages in discussions and exchanges with us, striving to enhance the contribution of every member. Moreover, he is meticulous, adding detailed code comments to every file. Without him, completing this assignment till now on us own would require an effort several times greater.>
